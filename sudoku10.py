# restart again
# I think I could finished the previous one, but I'm out of brain cell
# to figure out how to check how many(I mean if) solutions are left.
# I know I said I can check it by setting every cell to possible number,
# but I perfer not wasting too much time on that, as dispite taking little
# time to solve a sudoku, victory rely on doing more calculation than
# you oppponante, so time is money.
# Therefore, I've been studing mathamatic of sudoku on wikipedia, and will
# be doing it this way unless time run out(for me, not the program).
# For now, this will just be my note, as I hope not to forget everything
# I've learned and having to restudy everytime.

# Exact cover problem is:
# S is a set of subsets of X, and X is just a set. find subset S* of S,
# such that S*, after flattening, is equal to X
# Exact hitting problem is:
# S is a set, X is a set of subsets of S, find subset S* of S, such that
# every elements in X include exact one element in S*
#
# Those two are the same because for exact hitting problem, let S' be
# S, but every element replaced with all elements in X that include it.
# Now stop viewing elements in X as set, and S' will be set of subsets
# of X. Now the problem become find subset S*' of S', such that
# (since every element in X include exact one element in S*, and S*'
# has elements replaced, include become included, so) every elements
# in X is included in exactly one element in S*'. And as all s*'ÏµX,
# S*' is an exact cover of X.
#
# I used to love math before writing those
#
#
# For exact hitting, you(Yes, I use "you" when talking to myself) can imagine
# X as rules, where every element in x can appear only once in solution S*
# S = {Aa1, Aa2, Aa3 ... Aa9, Ab1, Ab2, ...}
# So we(Why did I use we this time? I don't know, this is just what I do when I
# sit in the corner talking to myself) need to find S* somewhat like this:
# (just an example) {Aa1, Ab2, Ac5, Ad3 ...}
# Rules include:
#   Include exactly one of Aa1, Aa2 ... (no dupe nor absent)
#   Include exactly one of Aa1, Ab1 ... (rules for rows)
#   Include exactly one of Aa1, Ba1 ... (rules for columns)
#   Include exactly one of Aa1, Ab1 ... (note: this is not for rows,
#                                        it's for blocks)
# And with them we can easily create X

# From Wikipedia: Knuth's Algorithm X
# # If the matrix A has no columns,
# the current partial solution is a valid solution; terminate successfully.
#       1. Otherwise choose a column c (deterministically).
#       2. Choose a row r such that Ar, c = 1 (nondeterministically).
#       3. Include row r in the partial solution.
#       4. For each column j such that Ar, j = 1,
#           for each row i such that Ai, j = 1,
#               delete row i from matrix A.
#           delete column j from matrix A.
#       5. Repeat this algorithm recursively on the reduced matrix A.
#
# This require we express it in matrix form, which I won't explain, because
# I believe I've memorized it.
#
#
# Acturally, if you think about it, it's not very different than brute
# force. It's adviced to choose the column with the least 1s, similar to
# chossing a grid in sudoku with least possiblity.

# This will be inplemented in a c++ version (If I can learn it in a month,
# since it is much faster, shouldn't be hard)
# The data will be in a matrix, with header tracking the number of 1s
# (as the matrix is going to be very sparse, with only 1/9 1s), and every
# row and column(including header) will form a doubly-linked list.
# Wikipedia doesn't metion any row-choosing method, so I'll have to make
# a python program to test it, and if there is a better method, may add
# column header
